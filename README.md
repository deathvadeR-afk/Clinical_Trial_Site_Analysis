## Configuration

### API Keys
To use this platform, you need API keys for:
- ClinicalTrials.gov
- PubMed
- Google Gemini (optional, for AI insights)
- OpenRouter (optional, for alternative AI insights)

Create a `config.json` file from `config.template.json` and add your API keys, or set them as environment variables:
- `CLINICAL_TRIALS_API_KEY`
- `PUBMED_API_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

## Excluded Files

The following files are excluded from version control for security and performance reasons:

### Database Files
- `clinical_trials.db` - Main production database (large file)
- `clinical_trials_backup.db` - Backup of main database
- All `*.db` files - SQLite database files

### Configuration Files
- `config.json` - Contains API keys and sensitive configuration
- `.env` files - Environment variables with sensitive data

### Cache and Logs
- `cache/` directory - Cached API responses
- `logs/` directory - Application logs
- `reports/` directory - Generated reports

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up configuration:
   ```bash
   cp config.template.json config.json
   # Edit config.json with your API keys
   ```

3. Run the main application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Access the dashboard:
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard/app.py
   ```

## Deployment to Streamlit Cloud

To deploy this application to Streamlit Cloud:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and create a new app
3. Select your forked repository
4. Set the main file path to `dashboard/app.py`
5. In the advanced settings, add the following environment variables:
   - `CLINICAL_TRIALS_API_KEY` - Your ClinicalTrials.gov API key
   - `PUBMED_API_KEY` - Your PubMed API key (optional)
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key (optional)
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - Your OpenRouter API key (optional)

6. Click "Deploy!"

The application will automatically initialize the database schema on first run.

## Database Management for Streamlit Cloud

**Important**: The database file [clinical_trials.db](file://e:\Codecademy\Clinical_Site_Trial_Analysis\clinical_trials.db) is located in the project root directory. When deploying to Streamlit Cloud, you have two options:

### Option 1: Start with Empty Database (Recommended)
- The application will automatically create an empty database with the correct schema
- Use the dashboard controls to ingest data:
  1. Click "📥 Ingest Latest Data" on the Home page
  2. Wait for data ingestion to complete
  3. Your data will be stored in the Streamlit Cloud environment

### Option 2: Copy Existing Database
If you have an existing database with data locally:
1. Copy your [clinical_trials.db](file://e:\Codecademy\Clinical_Site_Trial_Analysis\clinical_trials.db) file to the repository root
2. **Important**: Make sure to remove it from [.gitignore](file://e:\Codecademy\Clinical_Site_Trial_Analysis\.gitignore) temporarily if you want to commit it
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

**Note**: Database files are typically large and should not be committed to version control. For production use, consider using a managed database service.

## Local Development

For local development, you may need to initialize the database manually:

```bash
python initialize_dashboard.py
```

Then run the dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

## AI Insights Generation

To generate AI insights for all sites:

```bash
python ai_ml/generate_ai_insights.py
```

This script will use either OpenRouter or Gemini (depending on which API key is configured) to generate insights for each site.

## Security Notes

Never commit `config.json` or any files containing API keys to version control. Use environment variables for deployment.
