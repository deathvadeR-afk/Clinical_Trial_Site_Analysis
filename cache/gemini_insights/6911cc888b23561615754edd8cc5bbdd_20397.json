Given the limited information, the analysis will be based on the available data and reasonable assumptions.\n\n**Structured Analysis of Clinical Trial Site: 91 Thomas-Chapais**\n\n**Site Information Summary:**\n\n*   **Name:** 91 Thomas-Chapais\n*   **Location:** Boucherville, Canada\n*   **Institution Type:** Unknown\n*   **Total Participations:** 1\n\n**1. Key Strengths:**\n\n*   **Participation Record (Limited as it is):**  The fact that the site has participated in at least one trial indicates a willingness to engage in clinical research.  This is a foundational strength.\n*   **Canadian Location:** Canada has a well-regulated healthcare system and a population generally receptive to clinical research. This location could be advantageous for recruitment and data quality.\n*   **Established Presence (Assumption):**  The site's existence implies it has some level of operational infrastructure, even if the institution type is unknown. This includes basic facilities and personnel, even if the scale is uncertain.\n\n**2. Areas for Improvement:**\n\n*   **Data Scarcity:** The most significant area for improvement is the lack of data. We need information on:\n    *   **Institution Type:** Knowing if it's a hospital, private practice, academic center, or other type of institution is crucial.\n    *   **Investigator Information:**  Who are the Principal Investigators (PIs)? What are their specialties and experience?  What is their track record in clinical trials?\n    *   **Performance Metrics:**  We need data on:\n        *   Screening Failure Rate\n        *   Enrollment Rate\n        *   Retention Rate\n        *   Data Quality (e.g., query rate)\n        *   Adverse Event Reporting Compliance\n        *   Audit Findings\n        *   Cycle Times (e.g., time to IRB approval, time to first patient enrolled)\n    *   **Therapeutic Area Expertise:** What types of clinical trials has this site participated in? What therapeutic areas are they proficient in?\n*   **Low Participation Volume:**  A single trial participation suggests either a very new site or one that is underperforming.  Increasing the number of trials participated in is a primary goal.\n*   **Unknown Institutional Support:**  Without knowing the institution type, it's impossible to assess the level of support the site receives (e.g., dedicated research staff, resources, infrastructure).\n\n**3. Strategic Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Data Collection and Transparency:** The immediate priority is to gather more data. This involves:\n    *   **Site Qualification Visits (SQVs):** Conduct thorough SQVs to assess the site's capabilities, infrastructure, and personnel.\n    *   **Investigator Interviews:**  Interview the PIs to understand their experience, interests, and available resources.\n    *   **Performance Data Tracking:** Implement a system to track key performance indicators (KPIs) for all future trials.\n*   **Investigator Training and Development:**  If the PIs are relatively new to clinical research, provide training on Good Clinical Practice (GCP), protocol adherence, and data management.\n*   **Targeted Trial Selection:** Focus on trials that align with the investigators' expertise and the site's capabilities. Avoid overly complex trials initially.\n*   **Proactive Recruitment Strategies:** Develop and implement effective patient recruitment strategies, considering the local demographics and patient populations.\n*   **Relationship Building:**  Foster strong relationships with sponsors and Contract Research Organizations (CROs).  This can lead to more trial opportunities.\n*   **Marketing and Visibility:**  Promote the site's capabilities to potential sponsors and CROs.  This could involve attending industry conferences or creating a website or brochure.\n\n**4. Unique Capabilities:**\n\nWithout more information, it's difficult to identify unique capabilities.  However, potential unique capabilities could include:\n\n*   **Niche Patient Population:**  The site may have access to a specific patient population that is difficult to find elsewhere.\n*   **Specialized Equipment or Facilities:**  The site may possess specialized equipment or facilities that are valuable for certain types of trials.\n*   **Investigator Expertise:** The investigators may have unique expertise in a particular therapeutic area.\n*   **Bilingual Staff:** Being located in Canada, the site may have staff proficient in both English and French, which could be an advantage for trials involving both languages.\n\n**5. Risk Factors:**\n\n*   **Limited Experience:**  The low number of participations suggests a lack of experience, which could lead to challenges in trial execution.\n*   **Unknown Infrastructure:**  The unknown institution type raises concerns", "timestamp": 1762314714.7237535}
