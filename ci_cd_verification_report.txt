Conclusion
==========
The CI/CD pipeline is ready for GitHub Actions deployment. All components have been verified and are functioning correctly. The pipeline will:

1. Run code quality checks (flake8, black)
2. Execute unit tests with coverage reporting
3. Build and push Docker images
4. Deploy to production environment
5. Schedule automated data ingestion and ML retraining

No critical issues were found during verification.
